# ImageJ_Macros
A collection of ImageJ Macros to process data for some very specific applications. Probably of no use to anyone by me. 

The purpose of these macros is to tak data from our micro-CT scanners, and peform basic manipulation (cropping, thresholding, and masking) and extraction of meaningful numbers from. If  the preccessed images. If any of the macros are usful you, you're probably already working with me, if not then I'll help with any issues if I can. Be aware these macros are written to solve specific probelms and may not be any use to you.
